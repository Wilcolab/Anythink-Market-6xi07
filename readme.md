# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

**Step 1; Install Docker. Use the link https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ _
**Step 2; Create a docker account and sign into the account._
**Step 3; After docker has been installed, Open your_ terminal(mac)/cmd(windows)/bash(linux)_
**Step 4; Check if docker is installed by checking the versions using the below commands
    docker -v
    docker-compose -v _
**Step 5; Run docker-compose up on the terminal from the project root directory to load Anythink's backend and frontend _
    If Docker is working correctly, the backend should be running and able to connect to your local database. _
**Step 6; Test this by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping _
**Step 7; Check the frontend and make sure it’s connected to the backend. _
        If everything is working properly, you’ll be able to create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register _
**Step 8; Create a new user and let Ness know that you are connected _
**Just make sure that you run all scripts in the next quests on one of the containers created by docker-compose up.  Also, you can use docker exec to run commands on a running container.** _
